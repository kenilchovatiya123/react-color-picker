# React Color Picker Project  

A color picker application built with React.js, showcasing the use of React hooks such as `useState` to manage state effectively.  

## Description  

This project includes a color picker feature where:  
- Users can select any color using an input field of type "color."  
- The selected color is displayed in a dedicated color box along with its corresponding color code.  
- The `onChange` event is used to dynamically update the color box and display the selected color in real-time.  

The application demonstrates React.js concepts, particularly state management with `useState`.  

## Features  
- Interactive color selection using a native color picker.  
- Real-time color preview in a styled box.
